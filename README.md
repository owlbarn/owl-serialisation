owl-serialisation
====

Functions for serlialising Owl matrices and NDarrays.

At present only [bin_prot](https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot)-based
serialisation for dense matrices is provided.  See
[doc/bin_prot.md](doc/bin_prot.md).

Other kinds of serialization are expected to be added, such as json,
npy, and possibly hdf5.

## Setup

To build: `make`.

*TODO: Installation instructions, opam, etc.*

To build docs: `make doc`.  Then open
`_build/default/_doc/_html/owl_bin_prot/Owl_bin_prot/index.html` in a
browser.  (Or use e.g. `odig odoc` after installing `odig` and `odoc`.)

## Note

When using the functions in this library, North Americans may want to
keep in mind that the code uses British spelling for "seriali*s*ation".
